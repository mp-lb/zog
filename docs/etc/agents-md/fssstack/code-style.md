## Code style

- Use PascalCase for components
- Files should have 1 export, and should be named the same. E.g. MyComponent lives in MyComponent.tsx
- Use camelCase for constants, functions, mongo collections
- Use train_case for typed strings
- File routers are an exception
- Generally 1 function/class per file

### Functional decomposition

Good functional decomposition is essential. This applies to react components, hooks, backend functions. Continuously abstract and centralise important code. Functions should be small and "do one thing".

### Code organization

Maintain an extreme approach to code organization. Functions/components should never be large or complex. Generally every function should have it's own file. Those files should be well organised. Continuously break down programs and organise files so that it's always crystal clear what modules relate to each other. You have permission to do this at all times. Flag concerns with the developer if unsure.

Take extra care when organizing tests.

### Tech debt

In general, follow the boy scout principle. But if you come across tech debt that's too big to address, add a .md doc to docs/tech-debt and raise it with the user.
